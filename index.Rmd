## What Williams found ~50 years ago

- When a person searches for a target in cluttered a visual field, fixations typically fall on objects
- When the search field contains object differing widely in size, color and shape:
 * A high proportion of fixations were on objects of specified color
 * A moderate proportion of fixations were on objects of specified size or shape
 * When two or more target characteristics are specified, fixations were generally based on a single characteristic

### Williams 1967:

- One sample every 4 seconds

- One sample every 16 miliseconds

### CogWorks Lab >=2012:

- One sample every 2 miliseconds

## Corneal Reflex Eyetracking

Purkinje images (reflections) are used in eye tracking technology to locate the orientation of the eye, by comparing the position of the first reflection of a known, fixed, infrared light source with the position of the pupil.

## The Williams' Search Task

### Between 1966 and 1968 L.G. Williams published a series of seminal journal articles and tech reports on visual search.
